# BlockChangeHackathon
This is the repo for the project developed to participate in the Block &amp; Change Hackathon.

The project, QualiHire, is a job search platform that checks if the applicants match the job offer's requisits. This is done through NFTs: the companies may post positions that require certain NFT certifications (think of a future world where college titles, etc. get tokenized), and the platform checks if the applicant's connected wallet contains those NFTs, allowing the user to apply if they match the requirements. 

## Demo
Below you can see a video demo of our project!
